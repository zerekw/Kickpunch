Read, process, and write a set of resources as constructed by a profile. 

Usage with node.js:
node path/to/dojo/dojo.js load=build [options] 

Usage with java:
java -Xms256m -Xmx256m -jar path/to/util/shrinksafe/js.jar path/to/dojo/dojo.js baseUrl=path/to/dojo load=build [options]

Usage with the build script on non-windows:
IMPORTANT: the util/buildscripts directory must be the current working directory
./build.sh [options]

Usage with the build script on windows:
IMPORTANT: the util/buildscripts directory must be the current working directory
build.bat [options]

IMPORTANT:
This program assumes the default directory structure provided with the standard dojo source release.

IMPORTANT:
When using v1.6- profiles, this program assumes the current working directory is utils/buildscripts.

Options:
-p <filename>
--profile <filename>      read profile for file

-p <profile>
--profile <profile>       read profile from profile in util/buildscripts/profiles

--package <path>          read profile from package.json located in the directory path

-r
--require <filename>
--dojoConfig              read profile from loader configuration 

--htmlFiles <file-list>   deduce profile from HTML file(s); file-list is a comma-separated list of filenames

--htmlDir <path>          deduce profile from all HTML files in directory at path

--check                   print computed profile

--debug-check             print computed profile, including internal structures

--release                 process the build control script(s) and/or profile(s) and transform sources into a release

--releaseDir <path>       base directory for build output

--releaseName <string>    path segment to append to releaseDir that gives base directory for build output

--writeProfile <filename> write the processed profile to filename

--version <id>            stamp build with id; defaults to "0.0.0.dev"

--copyTests               Copy test files and the DOH package.

--mini                    Ignore resources tagged as not mini (e.g. tests, demos dijit/bench, etc.)

-v                        print the program's version number
